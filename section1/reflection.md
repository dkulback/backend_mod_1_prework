## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  * The SuperLearner Article resonated with me by reaffirming that their are methods that will increase productivity and insure success.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
I would create a helloworld.rb file then run the file in terminal with ruby helloworld.rb
1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

# also called a pound / hash / octothorpe

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
An integer is a whole number while a float is a number with decimal places both are numerical data.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
'''ruby
animal = "Zebra"
'''

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
'''ruby
p "#{animal}"
'''

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
interpolation is taking a defined variable and inserting in a code line that is indicated inside a double quote string.
'''ruby
p "The #{animal} was very friendly."
'''

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
The gets method will ask the user for data. Various gets like .chomp and others will add specific purposes. .chomp removes the /n (newline code at the end of a string)
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
.split will return the contents of a variable's string into individual strings in the format of an array.
.length will return the total number of individual characters the string consists of.
